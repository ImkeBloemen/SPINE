**SPINE** (Local Enriched Decision Boundary Map Visualization for Machine Learning Classifiers)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SPINE provides a visualization technique for enriched, local decision boundary mapping in machine learning. 
It assists researchers and practitioners in better understanding model behavior near decision boundaries, 
 for classification tasks of differentiable classifiers. This tool is developed to foster reproducibility and clarity when 
evaluating SPINE as a method.

Features
--------

- **More precise decision boundary mapping**: Generates more precise decision boundary mappings using SPINE. SPINE consists of three main contributions.
- **Enhanced projection  from nD to 2D**: Allows to use the output of a differentiable classifier and the final hidden layer of a trained classifier.
- **VAE-driven Boundary sampling**: Finds counterfactuals through an optimization algorithm and saves the intermediate points of this optimization.
- **kNN-weighted interpolation**: Finds the high-dimensional pixel representations by locally interpolating between known training and enriched data.

Installation
------------

This project uses **Poetry** for dependency management and packaging. There are two main ways to install and use SPINE:

1. **Install SPINE as a dependency in your Poetry-based project**:

   .. code-block:: bash

      poetry add spine

   This will add SPINE to your projectâ€™s dependencies and install it automatically.

2. **Clone the repository and install locally** (useful for development or contributions):

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/ImkeBloemen/SPINE.git
      cd SPINE
      poetry install

   This command sets up a virtual environment (if not already active) and installs all dependencies, including SPINE 
   itself, for local development.

Usage
-----

Once installed, you can import SPINE into your Python code and run the experiments in the src/spine/experiments folder. main_eval.py serves as the standard evaluation file for the complete process. eval_map.py can be used when the enriched data is already generated and one wants to only evaluate the decision boundary mapping technique.
